## The icons

Here's the set of SVG icons easily available on Papicu:

<p class="padded">
  {% include svg.html show_all="true" %}
</p>

<h2>How to use them {%- include svg.html icon="help" class="inline-icon" -%}</h2>

Basic use cases need just this one line of `liquid`:

{% raw  %}
```liquid
{%- include svg.html icon="NAME" -%}
```
{% endraw  %}

To find the `NAME` of an icon, please refer to `_includes/svg.html`. 

For more advanced usage, look up the source code of this demo site.
