# Papicu

[Papicu](https://lucasamaro.com/papicu) is a minimalist [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template and theme. 

It's been heavily inspired by [Clio](https://github.com/danromero/clio), another Jekyll theme. In fact, Papicu is basically a fork of Clio. 

I did make it to meet my own needs but, if you like it, Papicu is free to use and modify.

# Setup

## Option 1: use jekyll-remote-theme

First, have a Jekyll website/blog set up on your local machine. 

If you are new to Jekyll, get familiar with it first: [jekyllrb.com/docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`

    ```gemfile
    gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
    gem "katex", github: "lucasrla/katex-ruby"
    gem "kramdown-math-katex"
    ```

2. Install the gems by running on terminal

    ```sh
    bundle install
    ```

3. Add the following to your `_config.yml`

    ```yml
    markdown: kramdown

    kramdown:
      parse_block_html: true
      math_engine: katex

    plugins:
      - jekyll-remote-theme

    remote_theme: lucasrla/papicu
    ```

4. Run jekyll on terminal

    ```sh
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

5. Visit your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000

## Option 2: clone or fork this repository

If you are reasonably well-versed in Jekyll, clone or fork this repository and have fun. 


## ⚠️ GitHub Pages **not** supported out-of-the-box

Unfortunately, Papicu **is not compatible** with GitHub Pages standard workflow.

Why? Because, as of April 2021, GitHub Pages ([gem version 214](https://rubygems.org/gems/github-pages)) still uses Jekyll `=3.9.0`. Papicu needs Jekyll `~>4.1` for `slugified_categories` (i.e., [well-formed permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#placeholders)).

For those who are really interested, it is possible circumvent this limitation and run Papicu on GitHub Pages by using GitHub Actions. Read [Jekyll's official guide on GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) for the details.


# Usage

## Examples

Each example post inside `_posts/` demonstrates a few of Papicu features. 

Have a look, for example, at the post titled [A post with bells and whistles](https://papicu.netlify.app/post-with-bells-and-whistles/), and make sure you review its source code `_posts/2021-02-01-post-with-bells-and-whistles.md` as well.


## Favicon generator

Try [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net).


## Open Graph and Twitter Cards

1. Put the image file inside `/assets/img/og/`
2. Add the image filename to `ogimg:` in the post or page's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)

For an actual example, see `_posts/2021-01-01-textual-post.md`.


## Tips for a Jekyll setup on your local machine

First, you must install `ruby` and `bundler` locally. If you are on macOS, read the instructions at [lucasrla.github.io/macos-setup/ruby](https://lucasrla.github.io/macos-setup/ruby).

Next, make sure `bundler` is configured with isolated environments by project:

```sh
bundle config set bin bin/
bundle config set path vendor.noindex/
```

Now, install Jekyll:

```sh
bundle install

# and then check if it has been installed properly
bundle info jekyll
```

Finally, run:

```sh
# We are passing `local` as `jekyll.environment` and checking for that inside `default.html` 
# to avoid sending analytics events when running locally.
# For more info: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/environments/

JEKYLL_ENV=local bundle exec jekyll serve
```
